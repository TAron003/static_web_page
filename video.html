                        Young Percy talking with her mother.

                        <b>Percy Jackson:</b> Perseus. That's me.
                        <br>
                        Percy and Sally glance upon a statue of the greek hero Perseus inside <abbr title="Metropolitan Museum">The Met</abbr>.
                        <br>
                        <b>Sally Jackson (Percy's mom):</b> Mm-hm. That's who you're named after.

                        <b>Percy:</b> Because he was a hero?
                        <br>
                        <b>Sally:</b> Because he was brave and kind, and, against all odds, he managed to find his way to a happy ending.
                        <br>
                        While Sally speaks, a montage of scenes from the series plays: 
                        Percy, Annabeth and Grover arrives in the Underworld; 
                        Percy takes out a bag of blue jellybeans from his backpack; 
                        Grover uncontrollably slides down a slope;
                        the St. Louis Gateway Arch with a hole in it;
                        Percy running in a forest;
                        Percy plunges in the Mississippi river;
                        Percy standing in a thunderstorm, a lightning illuminates his face.

                        <br>
                        Percy and Grover sit on the edge of a fountain.
                        <br>
                        <b>Percy:</b> I'm used to the world feeling weird to me.

                        Percy stands before the Perseus statue in <abbr title="Metropolitan Museum">The Met</abbr>, looking up on it.
                        <br>
                        <b>Percy:</b> Like a puzzle with half the wrong pieces.
                        <br>
                        Percy's assignment paper comes in frame, the letters and words shift and blur.
                        <br>
                        Percy with widened eyes, shock and disbelief in his expression.
                        <br>
                        <b>Percy:</b> But lately, it all feels different somehow.
                        <br>
                        A black pegasus stands on a rooftop, spreads its wings.
                        <br>
                        <b>Mr. Brunner (<abbr title="also known as">a.k.a.</abbr> Chiron):</b> Percy, you're special.
                        <br>
                        Mr. Brunner hands a ballpoint pen to Percy.

                        The Minotaur crashes into the side of the car, breaking the windows, pieces of glass flying everywhere.
